1.2 Abstract

## Abstract

Chatbo Tools is dedicated to enhancing the safety and effectiveness of trading in the crypto trenches with a suite of innovative utilities.

Our flagship offering is an AI agent designed for on-chain analysis, specifically targeting newly migrated or pre-migration coins with market caps starting at $20k.

Key features include an AI agent for coin analysis that utilizes the ElizaOS framework to delve into both blockchain data and human-centric red flags, such as website aesthetics, project narratives, and psychological trading patterns.

This holistic approach provides traders with insights that raw data alone cannot offer. Future developments will include a CROY Rick Bot for Telegram, inspired by the well-known Rick Bot, and a user dashboard for real-time feedback on coin launches.
